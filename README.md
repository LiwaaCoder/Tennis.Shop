- Add rackets to the shopping cart.
- Authenticate users using Firebase Authentication.
- Securely process payments with Apple Pay.
- Store and retrieve racket photos using Firebase Storage.

## Technologies Used

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tennis-shop.git`
2. Install Cocoapods dependencies: `pod install`
3. Set up Firebase project:
   - Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add iOS app to the project and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
   - Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the root directory of the project.
4. Enable Apple Pay:
   - Set up Apple Pay entitlements and merchant ID in your Apple Developer account.
   - Configure Apple Pay in your Xcode project.
5. Build and run the app on a simulator or physical device.

Note: Make sure you have Xcode 12 or later and Cocoapods installed on your machine.

## Configuration

To configure the Firebase services and Apple Pay functionality, follow these steps:

1. Firebase Storage:
   - Ensure the Firebase project is set up and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file is in the correct location.
   - Configure Firebase Storage rules to secure access to the racket photos.
   - Update the Firebase Storage references in the app code to match your project structure.

2. Firebase Authentication:
   - Enable the desired authentication methods (email/password, Google, etc.) in the Firebase project console.
   - Update the app code to handle user authentication flows using Firebase Authentication APIs.

3. Apple Pay:
   - Set up Apple Pay entitlements and merchant ID in your Apple Developer account.
   - Configure the Apple Pay settings in your Xcode project.
   - Integrate Apple Pay functionality in the app code to handle payments.

## Limitations

- The TennisShop app currently focuses on displaying and purchasing tennis rackets only. Additional features like user profiles, order history, and reviews could be implemented in future updates.
